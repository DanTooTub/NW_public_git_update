 AFG_disarming_the_tribes_desc: "One of the main challenges in modernizing Afghanistan is the multitude of armed tribes that refuse to accept the authority of the central government. The disarmament of tribes began in the late 19th century but was constantly interrupted by their uprisings and changes in power, leading to further developments in smuggling and interethnic conflicts. The greatest success was achieved by the predecessor of Zahir Shah and Hashim, Nader Shah, who managed to partially disarm the Hazaras and major settlements in the west. To resolve tribal conflicts and suppress opposition, our authorities need to utilize the capabilities of the army and officials to conduct the disarmament of Pashtun, Tajik, and Hazara tribes in other regions."

 NW_AFG_disarm.0.t: "Resistance to Disarmament"
 NW_AFG_disarm.0.d: "When conscription for military service between the ages of 20 and 45 began, the local population attempted to bribe their way out with money and livestock, although around 100 people still ended up as soldiers. However, the population of the region soon revolted against the authorities, setting up armed checkpoints on the passes to prevent Afghan troops from entering."
 NW_AFG_disarm.0.a: "Coexisting with tribes is challenging."
 NW_AFG_disarm.1.t: "Reluctant Surrender of Rifles"
 NW_AFG_disarm.1.d: "During disarmament, our government deployed small garrisons in several locations, and the cost of maintaining them fell heavily on the peasantry. It should be noted that when asked to voluntarily surrender weapons, the peasantry only handed over a small number of modern rifles, and the commission's trophies consisted mainly of flintlock and matchlock guns. The majority of the weapons were preserved and hidden."
 NW_AFG_disarm.1.a: "This is already a success in centralizing the state."
 NW_AFG_disarm.2.t: "Successful Disarmament"
 NW_AFG_disarm.2.d: "During disarmament, our government deployed small garrisons in several locations, and the cost of maintaining them fell heavily on the peasantry. Surprisingly, the tribes handed over examples of modern weaponry to the government commission and provided some of their warriors for service at the following rates: infantryman for 720 Afghanis, cavalryman for 1,440 Afghanis."
 NW_AFG_disarm.2.a: "We are pleased to collaborate with them."
 NW_AFG.0.t: "Path to Independence"
 NW_AFG.0.d: "In 1919, Amanullah Khan declared Afghanistan's independence from Britain; the authorities of Soviet Russia welcomed this act. After another Anglo-Afghan war, Britain recognized its independence. During his reign, numerous Western-style liberal reforms were implemented.\n\nIn 1929, Amanullah Khan was overthrown as a result of Bacha-i-Saqqao's uprising. In the same year, an unsuccessful attempt was made to restore Amanullah Khan's rule with the help of Soviet troops. However, the civil war did not end there. In late summer 1929, the Minister of War under Amanullah and his cousin, Muhammad Nadir, revolted against Bacha-i-Saqqao and overthrew him in the same year, with the support of the British.\n\nMuhammad Nadir became the Shah of Afghanistan. On November 8, 1933, during a ceremony at the "Nedzhat" lyceum, he was shot by Abdul Khalik Hazara, a 19-year-old student of the lyceum. His son, Zahir, became the Shah (king). However, taking advantage of his inexperience, the country was effectively ruled by his uncle, Hashim Khan, who held conservative and nationalist views. Suppressing all opposition, he pursued a policy of slow modernization."
 NW_AFG.0.a: "Let's unite and defend our independence!"
 NW_AFG.1.t: "Opening of Telegraph Line with Iran"
 NW_AFG.1.d: "After resolving the border conflict, efforts were made to strengthen relations with Iran. As a sign of reconciliation, direct telegraph communication was established: the Afghan line connected to the Iranian one at Kalk-Ale."
 NW_AFG.1.a: "We should pay more attention to our neighbors."
 NW_AFG.3.t: "Overthrow of Hashim Khan"
 NW_AFG.3.d: "Following the rise of pro-fascist sentiments, young members of the Barakzai dynasty forced the king to dissolve the existing government led by Hashim Khan. To achieve this, the head of the central army corps, Muhammad Daoud Khan, surrounded the prime minister's residence and forced him to sign his abdication.\nAfghanistan will now rely on Pashtun tribes."
 NW_AFG.3.a: "For our distant partners!"
 NW_AFG.4.t: "Hashim Khan's Ousting"
 NW_AFG.4.d: "A new cabinet led by the king's uncle, Shah Mahmud Khan, came to power in Afghanistan. The transfer of power was not without its difficulties. The formal reason for Hashim Khan's resignation was his 'poor health.'\nThe change of the cabinet took many Afghans by surprise since, during Hashim Khan's rule, his name had become closely associated with stable authoritarianism.\nThe change of the prime minister also serves the interests of the royal court: Zahir Shah believes it is time for him to play a more significant role in politics, which was impossible under Hashim Khan's despotic rule, and other members of the royal family are also eager to participate in governing the country. Hashim Khan's refusal to voluntarily step down forced the king to take drastic measures: the prime minister's residence was surrounded by soldiers, and he was effectively given an ultimatum. Hashim Khan decided to comply, thus ending his political career."
 NW_AFG.4.a: "A New Cabinet, new reforms."
 NW_AFG.5.t: "Preparation of Basmachi Bands"
 NW_AFG.5.d: "In the border areas with the USSR, several large Basmachi bands were hastily formed with the goal of attacking the border posts of the Takhta-Bazar and Kerkinsky border troops and robbing the Evdokimov Collective Farm on the Murgab direction."
 NW_AFG.5.a: "Protest against this!"
 NW_AFG.5.b: "Turn a blind eye."
 NW_AFG_SOV.0.t: "Basmachi Raid"
 NW_AFG_SOV.0.d: "A large Basmachi gang, assembled in Afghanistan, carried out a raid on the border posts of the Takhta-Bazar and Kerkinsky border troops and robbed the Evdokimov Collective Farm on the Murgab direction. After the robbery, they returned almost without losses."
 NW_AFG_SOV.0.a: "The Afghan government, as our friend, should have prevented this."
 NW_AFG.6.t: "Arrival of Ismail Balkhi in Herat"
 NW_AFG.6.d: "Sayed Ismail Balkhi, a Hazara Shiite born in Afghanistan who had received education in Iraq and Iran, returned to his homeland a few months ago after facing persecution by Reza Shah Pahlavi's regime for his involvement in an Islamist uprising. Upon arriving in Afghanistan, he delivered a speech at a congregational mosque gathering of scholars, elders, Shiites, and Sunnis, condemning Reza Shah's policies, especially the ban on the hijab. Sayed Ismail Balkhi's speech was well-received by Shiite and Sunni scholars. Continuing his philosophical, religious, political, and mystical pursuits under the guidance of Sheikh Muhammad Tahir Kandahari, he attracted the attention of people and intellectuals in society against the royal family and state officials with his fiery speeches in Herat.\n\nIn the current situation, Iran has requested his extradition to deal with the instigator of the uprising."
 NW_AFG.6.a: "We should extradite him to Iran for execution."
 NW_AFG.6.b: "We will restrict his travel outside Herat."
 NW_AFG.6.c: "He poses no threat."
 NW_AFG.7.t: "Formation of the 'Islamic Cultural Association'"
 NW_AFG.7.d: "Ismail Balkhi, located in Herat, has gained followers among both Sunni and Shiite elites under the banners of Islamic unity and state reforms. He founded the 'Islamic Cultural Association' movement, uniting his ideas about democracy and Muslim unity. Ismail advocates for broad public participation in governing the state and may be willing to resort to radical methods to achieve his goals."
 NW_AFG.7.a: "We will not allow him further participation in politics."
 NW_AFG.7.b: "He is not a threat to our authority."
 NW_AFG.9.t: "Foundation of the 'Hizb Irshad' Party"
 NW_AFG.9.d: "Ismail Balkhi, having gained supporters in Herat, with his speeches visited Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul, where many clerics and tribal leaders dissatisfied with the moderately liberal rule of [ROOT.GetLeader], which they see as departing from Islamic principles, joined his 'Islamic Cultural Association' movement. He formed the central committee of the 'Islamic Cultural Association' in Kabul, including Haji Mohammad Naim Kabuli, Ismail Sarh Parsa, Mohammad Ibrahim Gaweswar, Gurban Nazar Turkmeni, Abdul Ghayat Kohistani, Golam Haider Bayat, and many other religious and political figures. Based on this, he founded the 'Hizb Irshad' (Guidance Party) with some of the main goals being the fight against tyranny, backwardness, and ignorance, as well as achieving freedom, meritocracy, and progress with a democratic system. To achieve these goals, the party's primary demand was a fundamental change in the political system by overthrowing the ruling system of the time and establishing an Islamic Republic. Attempts to ban this organization are likely to lead them to become disillusioned with peaceful means and may attempt armed rebellion."
 NW_AFG.9.a: "We can't do anything about it now."
 NW_AFG.9.b: "We will restrict their activities."
 NW_AFG.10.t: "Attempt to Establish the 'Hizb Irshad' Party"
 NW_AFG.10.d: "Ismail Balkhi, located in Herat, despite his aspirations, failed to leave the city, which resulted in the failure of his attempt to create a full-fledged political movement. Currently, he continues his propagandist activities in his hometown."
 NW_AFG.10.a: "This suits us."
 NW_AFG.12.t: "Disappointment of the Tribes"
 NW_AFG.12.d: "Leaders of bordering tribes were disappointed by the state-sponsored war propaganda. After rallying many of their fellow tribesmen for jihad, they found themselves in civil service, far from home."
 NW_AFG.12.a: "We should not have given them false hope."
 NW_AFG.13.t: "Attack on a Military Post"
 NW_AFG.13.d: "In one of the border provinces, tribes attacked a military post with the aim of extracting their fellow tribesmen from the state army. Several of our soldiers were killed."
 NW_AFG.13.a: "This is an unpleasant situation."
 NW_AFG.14.t: "Shami Pir's Rebellion"
 NW_AFG.14.d: "Several viziers from South and West Waziristan crossed the Afghan border for looting and to lead a rebellion against the reigning Afghan dynasty. This movement is a result of months-long agitation in Waziristan by Sayed Mohammad Sadi, widely known as Shami Pir (Syrian Imam), a cleric from Damascus, whose family has connections to the former king Amanullah. A rebellion led by Suleiman Khel erupted in southeastern Afghanistan, and soon the number of rebels reached 2000. The government, monitoring Shami Pir's activities, was not caught off guard and quickly dispatched two brigades with ten planes, which were later reinforced by two more brigades. The rebels suffered defeat in two battles, and the rebellion soon ended."
 NW_AFG.14.a: "This was a heavy blow for us."
 NW_AFG.16.t: "Tribal Uprising"
 NW_AFG.16.d: "Many of the reforms enacted in the interest of the state did not have the support of Tajik and Pashtun tribes in the eastern regions of the country. They refused to serve the interests of the ruling monarchy in Kabul. Attacks on posts and fortifications in Pashto-speaking regions have escalated recently, culminating in tribesmen who switched sides to the rebels declaring jihad against Muhammadzai. Numerous tribal forces will be forced to clash with the prepared royal army, some of whom have defected to their side. Invitations have already been sent to Amanullah through Italy for his return to the throne. Currently, the uprising is led by Fakir Ipi, who escaped from Pakistan."
 NW_AFG.16.a: "Death to the rebels!"
 NW_AFG.16.b: "Death to the usurpers!"
 NW_AFG.17.t: "Tribal Uprising"
 NW_AFG.17.d: "Many of the reforms enacted in the interest of the state did not have the support of Tajik and Pashtun tribes in the eastern regions of the country. They refused to serve the interests of the ruling monarchy in Kabul. Attacks on posts and fortifications in Pashto-speaking regions have escalated recently and reached their peak when tribal leaders who joined the rebels declared jihad against the modernist regime. The influential tribal leader Fazl Omar Mojaddedi became the leader of the rebels, who had previously supported the Bacha-i-Saqao uprising in 1929."
 NW_AFG.17.a: "Death to the Deobandists!"
 NW_AFG.17.b: "Insha Allah!"
 NW_AFG.18.t: "Tajik Uprising"
 NW_AFG.18.d: "Incompetent rule under [ROOT.GetLeader] has led the Tajik population to rise against the Kabul government, ignoring tax and conscription demands. Suppressing an uprising of such a large ethnic group will take a long time."
 NW_AFG.18.a: "We should have monitored the Tajiks more closely."
 NW_AFG.19.t: "Young Clan Representatives Demand Easing of Censorship"
 NW_AFG.19.d: "Na'im, Daud's brother, and Zaher, the king of Afghanistan who is a puppet in the hands of the Muhammadzai family, demand the repeal of some recent censorship measures."
 NW_AFG.19.a: "We will listen to them."
 NW_AFG.19.b: "We will ignore their demands."
 NW_AFG.20.t: "Pashtuns Abandoned Their Farms"
 NW_AFG.20.d: "It was planned to resettle up to 100,000 people from the southeast to the north of Afghanistan under favorable conditions, providing a loan of 3,300 Afghanis per family and allocating plots of land of at least 3 hectares. However, the Pashtuns, not accustomed to sedentary farming, soon returned to the mountains with their herds, abandoning the land given to them, further fueling the discontent of the local population."
 NW_AFG.20.a: "This was expected."
 NW_AFG.21.t: "Failure of Gold Mining"
 NW_AFG.21.d: "Recent attempts to extract gold in the Kokcha and Amu Darya river basin regions have failed as the annual production was only 32 kilograms, and the cost of production exceeded the market price of the metal."
 NW_AFG.21.a: "Terrible!"
 NW_AFG.22.t: "Uprising in Hazarajat"
 NW_AFG.22.d: "Ibrahim Gausavar, known as the 'Son of the Bull Rider,' the leader of the Hazaras, has risen in rebellion against Afghanistan's predatory policies. After a brief siege of Shahristan, the rebels obtained ammunition and weapons. They are now prepared to engage in battle in the Hazarajat mountains."

 NW_AFG.22.b: "We will break free from Pashtun oppression!"
 NW_AFG.23.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] is Dead!"
 NW_AFG.23.d: "Disillusioned with peaceful means of protest, members of the 'Hizb Irshad' party decided to assassinate the ruler and overthrow the monarchical system. This morning, [ROOT.GetLeader] was shot in Kabul, followed by the council of ulemas declaring the establishment of an Islamic Republic under the leadership of Ismail Balkhi. At the same time, the al-Yahya clan left Afghanistan without managing to create a counterbalance to the influential clergy."
 NW_AFG.23.a: "Long live the revolution!"
 NW_AFG.24.t: "Neutrality Treaty with the USSR"
 NW_AFG.24.d: "On June 24, 1931, a mutual non-aggression treaty was signed between the USSR and Afghanistan. The Soviet government aimed to support good neighborly relations between the new regime of Nadir Shah and the USSR. The treaty's term is expiring soon, so it's time to decide on its renewal."
 NW_AFG.24.a: "Let's renew the treaty."
 NW_AFG.24.b: "We should terminate it."
 NW_AFG.25.t: "US Concession"
 NW_AFG.25.d: "The American company 'Inland Exploration Company' has requested a concession from our government for the exploration and exploitation of oil deposits and other resources across Afghanistan for a period of 75 years, with the possibility of obtaining concessions for their extraction if found. The Americans have agreed to pay Kabul 330,000 pounds sterling in the first year of operation and 20% of their income each subsequent year."
 NW_AFG.25.a: "We will grant them the right."
 NW_AFG.25.b: "We will remain loyal only to our own companies."
 NW_AFG.26.t: "Cancellation of Concession"
 NW_AFG.26.d: "Less than a year passed before the 'Inland Exploration Company' withdrew from the concession. Geologists explained to the Afghans that the rich oil deposits were inaccessible and would require an estimated $300 million to begin extraction. Additionally, Americans argued that the communication infrastructure in Afghanistan was poor, and building an oil pipeline to the Arabian Sea coast would be unprofitable."
 NW_AFG.26.a: "At least they contributed thousands of dollars to our treasury..."
 NW_AFG.27.t: "Death of Shady-Ogra"
 NW_AFG.27.d: "The first raid by the Basmachi gang led by Shady-Ogra, a former guide of the famous Kurbaashi Uzun-bek, from Afghanistan into Soviet territory occurred on March 18. Many raids were carried out over the course of three weeks. Today, his gang has been completely destroyed."
 NW_AFG.27.a: "The bandit is buried in the ground."
 NW_AFG_ENG.0.t: "Afghanistan Demands Waziristan"
 NW_AFG_ENG.0.d: "The Afghan government has demanded the transfer of Waziristan in exchange for unconditional support of British rule and the abandonment of subsequent claims."
 NW_AFG_ENG.0.a: "Afghanistan will be a valuable ally..."
 NW_AFG_ENG.0.b: "This is an insult!"
 NW_AFG_ENG.1.t: "British Refusal"
 NW_AFG_ENG.1.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to transfer Waziristan peacefully."
 NW_AFG_ENG.1.a: "In that case, we must recognize the 'Durand Line'..."
 NW_AFG_ENG.1.b: "We will find other allies."
 NW_AFG.28.t: "Return of Amanullah"
 NW_AFG.28.d: "After the uprising in 1929, caused by radical reforms that did not find approval in Afghan society and among the clergy, Amanullah Khan was forced to leave the country. Formerly a king, he went to Europe from British India and settled in Italy, purchasing a villa in the Rome district of Prati.\nAfter his overthrow, there were multiple uprisings that did not result in the overthrow of the government in Kabul, but this time, the insurgents have succeeded. Amanullah has returned from Italy and has been re-crowned as the Amir of Afghanistan. This time, he will need to gradually introduce innovations into the lives of the Afghan people to avoid another overthrow."
 NW_AFG.28.a: "Afghanistan will become modern!"
 NW_AFG_KAS.0.t: "Invitation to the Federation"
 NW_AFG_KAS.0.d: "Our uprising and the establishment of East Turkestan have not been without the assistance of the Afghan Kingdom. Currently, we have been offered membership in the Central Asian Islamic Federation, promising prosperity and autonomy to our region."

 NW_AFG.30.t: "Oppression of Women"
 NW_AFG.30.d: "When the news of women being liberated from traditional duties and given rights reached the villages, the situation worsened. Many Pashtun men began terrorizing girls who started to remove their burqas and work alongside men. If they faced only sidelong glances at work, as soon as they stepped out, they were stoned, as they were seen as committing kufr."
 NW_AFG.30.a: "This is a terrible situation, but reforms will continue."
 NW_AFG.30.b: "We should reconsider the reforms."
 NW_AFG.31.t: "Pashtuns Reject the Authority of Balh"
 NW_AFG.31.d: "Pashtun tribes are disappointed with the new government led by a Hazara Shiite who has no connections to noble families and comes from a modest background. Although he is a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, he is on the brink of being overthrown by Pashtun tribes."
 NW_AFG.31.a: "I seek Allah's protection from the cursed Shaytan!"
 NW_AFG.32.t: "Failure of Land Reform"
 NW_AFG.32.d: "Land owned by leaders was essentially used by the entire tribe, allowing coordination within the village. When the state apparatus arrived in the village, the land was divided in a way that made water distribution difficult, and many farms began to decline."
 NW_AFG.32.a: "This is terrible."
 NW_AFG.33.t: "Rise of Religious Radicalism"
 NW_AFG.33.d: "Pashtun tribes, adhering to the Pashtunwali code that prescribes belief in one God, saw in Ismail Balh's politics the idea of multiple gods, which threatens Pashtun traditional practices. They target the followers of the new doctrine under the slogans of the Deobandis."
 NW_AFG.33.a: "Wallahi, they are the ones betraying Allah and His Prophet Muhammad!"

 NW_AFG.35.t: "Northern Regions Reject Pashtun Nationalist Rule"
 NW_AFG.35.d: "The traditionally fragile ethnopolitical situation in Afghanistan collapsed after the declaration of a mono-national state led by the Pashtuns. Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, and other ethnic groups refused to obey the Kandahar Decree."
 NW_AFG.35.a: "They have chosen their own path."
 NW_AFG.37.t: "[FROM.GetName] Offers Peace"
 NW_AFG.37.d: "The colonial war has become a heavy burden for the metropolis, and with the fall of the regime in India, resistance has become entirely futile. [FROM.GetLeader] proposes to end the war in the current status."
 NW_AFG.37.a: "We agree."
 NW_AFG.37.b: "This is an insult."

Attempts by the government under Amanullah Khan to create a unified system of conscription and to abandon tribal militias resulted in a tribal uprising and the overthrow of the monarch. We should consider the tribal leaders and partially rely on convening tribes. Moreover, the mobilization capability of Afghan tribal militias is quite high. A government decree issued in early August 1930, summarizing the Kuh-e Daman operation, noted that only four days were given for convening tribal militias."

Furthermore, Jafari only accepts Sunnah reports that trace back to the Prophet Muhammad's early companions.
