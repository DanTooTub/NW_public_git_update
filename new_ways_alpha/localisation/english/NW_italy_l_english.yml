 NWitaly.11.desc:0 "From the beginning, 'Giustizia e Libertà' served as a liberal-socialist political movement and played a crucial role in informing and exposing the reality of fascist Italy, which was hidden behind the regime's propaganda. However, after the mass arrests of its members in 1930, the group was virtually decapitated.\n\nNow is the time to revive the movement and make it the voice of the Italian Commune. Where should we focus our efforts?"
