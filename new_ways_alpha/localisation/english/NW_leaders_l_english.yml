 POLITICS_MUSTAFA_KEMAL_ATATURK_DESC: "Mustafa Kemal was not born into the family of a rich official or a high-ranking general, but thanks to his personal determination and proactivity, he became the leader of the Turkish people and prevented the country from being colonised by the Entente countries. However, his policy was never characterized by hatred of Europe — on the contrary, he strived for the Europeanization and modernization of Turkish society and promoted Turkish nationalism. For his service, Mustafa Kemal received the surname Atatürk, Father of the Turks."
 POLITICS_PIERRE_LAVAL_DESC: "Pierre Laval was appointed the Republican Dictator for a good reason: he has always been a strong leader who always knows what to do. His new position has opened a range of opportunities to strengthen state media control that expanded public support for goverment policies. However, the socialists do not particularly enjoy Laval for his support of Mussolini's regime and authoritarian forms of government in general; Laval, in response, does everything possible to defeat left-wing politicians."
 POLITICS_ADOLF_HITLER_DESC: "A private, who made it through the horrors of the First World War, the poverty and political mess of Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, with a rethoric that appealed to the hearts of the Germans. Adolf has reached the position of the absolute leader of the new German Reich and is idolized by his comrades and ordinary Germans. As for non-Germans, the Fuhrer treats them with caution at best, and more often with hatred and a desire to destroy. Critics and opponents of the ruler and his course have disappeared, or will disappear soon. Adolf Hitler, as Germans believe, will ensure the prosperity of the Thousand-Year Reich, no matter how insidious the enemies turned out to be."
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_STALIN_DESC: "Having earned the reins of power after Lenin's death and a brief period of internal struggle, Joseph Stalin has led the young Union through unprecedented measures to overcome years of backwardness. He pulled the Soviet Russia, which united around itself a dozen of socialist republics, out of ruin and poverty, and made it one of the most powerful nations on the planet. The Friend, Leader and Teacher of the Soviet people is loved and respected, even if his paranoia has become noticeable, and his vanity has grown. Millions of Soviet citizens, however, praise the Father of Nations and do not notice this, carrying on being confident in the loyalty of Joseph Vissarionovich course, which he leads the USSR."

 POLITICS_REZA_SHAH_PAHLAVI_DESC: "Having declared himself the Shahanshah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi modernized his homeland into an advanced regional power. He actively carried out new reforms, destroying the old way of life: under his rule, the political parties formed, the national identity grew, and the clergy influence weakened. According to the monarch, only great people like Reza Shah Pahlavi and Adolf Hitler were capable of such reforms. Pahlavi believes in a bigger role of Hitler in the formation of the Iranian economy. But, in any case, these facts could not overshadow the past of Reza Shah, who used to head the Cossack brigade - after all, he still pays special attention to army needs."

 POLITICS_Thomas_Folkner_DESC: "Faulkner is one of the few people to challenge the despotism of the Whig party. A successful industrialist and a Commissioner of Monrovia, he did a lot for the region hoping to make an industrial breakthrough. He gathered like-minded people around him, but lost the election against Charles King, however there is little doubt that the election itself is corrupt in human history. After losing the next election, he opposed the entire Whig government, exposing slavery to the League of Nations, but international community did nothing. Only with the support of Juah Nimley, he was able to achieve a positive result and win new elections, launching a full industrialization."

 POLITICS_HERMANN_GORING_DESC: "Herman Göring came from a famous family. His father, Heinrich Göering, was a personal friend of Otto von Bismarck and a Governor-General of German Southwest Africa Ernst. But Herman himself didn’t fall short: during the Great War, he was an adjutant of an infantry battalion and later became a fighter pilot. Herman Göering has proven himself to be a fearless aviator, often neglecting the danger of death. In 1922, Göering met Adolf Hitler and became actively involved in the Nazi movement. Göering also participated in the Beer Hall Putsch attempt, when was seriously wounded. Since then, he lived in Austria, Italy, and Sweden; at the same time Goering developed an addiction to morphine, which caused a mental disturbance. After his recovery and return home, he became politically active, being de facto the second man in the party after Hitler. He was involved in the creation of the air force of the Reich — the Luftwaffe. Unlike his party comrades, he is not so radical in his views and is not subject to Nazi ideology. As a result, he often goes against racial laws and is also ready to compromise with other political forces."
 POLITICS_HEINRICH_HIMMLER_DESC: "Heinrich Himmler graduated from the Higher Technical School of Munich with a degree in Agronomy. In August 1923, Himmler joined the NSDAP with party number 14303 and took part in an unsuccessful attempt by the Nazis to seize power in Munich, known as Beer Hall Putsch. Frustrated by his failures, Himmler became irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating himself from both friends and relatives. His new religion became Germanic mythology, supplemented with elements of the occult. The political aspect of his view of the world was in line with the program of the Nazis. Initially, Himmler was not fond of Hitler and did not share Adolf’s personality cult. Later, however, Himmler came to regard the Führer as useful for the role of party figure. In September 1927, Heinrich Himmler voiced to Hitler the idea of transforming the SS into a powerful racially pure, and unconditionally loyal fighting unit. In 1929, by the order of Adolf Hitler, he was appointed Reichsfuhrer of the SS. Himmler created in the SS a cult of ancestors — which, however, went beyond the organization — to maintain the purity of the race and the myth of the immortality of the German people."
 POLITICS_CARL_FRIEDRICH_GOERDELER_DESC: "Friedrich Goerdeler was born into the family of a Prussian civil servant. Like his three brothers, he received a law degree from the University of Tübingen and the University of Königsberg. In 1919, he acted as a political mediator at the headquarters of the 17th Army Corps. In 1920, he joined the right-wing German National People’s Party and remained a member until 1931. In 1920-1930, he was the second mayor of Königsberg and later served as the Lord Mayor of Leipzig. As a municipal figure, Friedrich Goerdeler paid much attention to saving the city budget, strictly balancing the revenues and expenditures, and striving for an increase in labor productivity. In 1932, the retiring Reich Chancellor Heinrich Bruning recommended Goerdeler as his successor, but his candidacy was rejected by Reich President Paul von Hindenburg. Initially, he was sympathetic to the Nazis coming to power, believing that only hard power can stabilize the political and socio-economic situation in the country. By the mid-1930s, however, there were growing differences between Goerdeler and the Nazis - in particular, he was a monarchist and had a negative view of their economic, racial, and ecclesiastical policies. He was a natural-born organizer, an able orator, and a writer. A warm-hearted and humane man at heart, Goerdeler was an unwavering believer in the necessity of adhering to strict puritan moral principles. Perhaps that is why he lacked warmth in his dealings with people. He is by nature a true autocrat, a leader confident in his views, which enables him to easily persuade weak or wavering people to adopt his point of view and follow him."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_III_DESC: "Wilhelm III, the heir to the German Imperial throne, was born on May 6, 1882, at the Marble Palace in Potsdam to the future German Emperor Wilhelm II of  Hohenzollern. During the Great War, Wilhem III personally commanded a group of armies on the Western Front, but in the November armistice, Crown Prince was forced to resign and settle in exile in Osterland on the island of Virgen in the Netherlands together with his father. Five years later, he received permission to live in Germany and settled on his estate near Potsdam. In 1932, Wilhem III attempted to run for the presidency but failed to obtain his father’s permission. Consequently, he rallied behind Adolf Hitler and publicly supported the National Socialists, and urged his father to declare his sympathies for the Führer. Hitler, on his side, had convinced Wilhelm that he saw «the restoration of the monarchy as the crowning achievement of his aspirations». The Nazis took advantage of this trust and used it to their advantage, calling Wilhelm III «an idiot and a fool» among themselves. At the same time, Wilhelm III remained in deference to parts of the military who wanted to restore the monarchy, but considered the Nazis too radical in their political program."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_III_FRIEDRICH_FRANZ_DESC: "Prince Wilhelm Olaf of Prussia was born on 4 July 1960. On his tenth birthday in 1916, Wilhelm was made a lieutenant in the 1st Guards Regiment and was given the Order of the Black Eagle by his grandfather. Two years later, when he was only 12, the German monarchy was abolished. Wilhelm and his family remained in Germany.

 POLITICS_OSKAR_KARL_VON_PREUSSEN_DESC: "Prince Oskar of Prussia was educated as a cadet at the Prinzenhaus in Plön, as were all the Prussian princes. In 1914, he morganatically married Ina Marie von Bassewitz, so his children are excluded from the royal line of succession. A Great War veteran, he was awarded the wound badge for his injuries. After the war, he became interested in military unions, and in 1927 he became a Master of Knights, Protestant Order of Saint John.

 POLITICS_HELMUT_JAMES_VON_MOLTKE_DESC: "Helmuth James von Moltke was born in the noble von Moltke family of Christian Scientists.  In 1928, Moltke became involved with college teachers and youth movement leaders in the organization of the Löwenberg working groups in which unemployed young workers and young farmers were brought together with students so that they could learn from one another. He opposed National Socialism ideology because of his moral and religious beliefs, and in 1935 he declined the chance to become a judge to avoid having to join the Nazi Party. Instead, he opened a law practice in Berlin. As a lawyer, he helped the victims of Hitler’s régime."
 POLITICS_KONRAD_ADENAUER_DESC: "Konrad Adenauer was born in Cologne, Rhenish Prussia, on 5 January 1876. At the age of 18, he volunteered to join the army, where he served for 15 years. In 1906 he joined Zentrum and was elected to Cologne’s city council in the same year. In 1932, he became the president of the Prussian State Council. At first Adenauer, as a mayor of Cologne, believe that it was possible to find allies in Nazism in a joint fight against communism, but Adenauer finally realized the futility of any attempts at compromise with the Nazis. On 4 April 1933, he was officially dismissed as mayor and his bank accounts were frozen. During the next two years, Adenauer changed residences often for fear of reprisals against him, while living on the benevolence of friends. He remains on the opponent of the Nazi regime but is no friend of communists either."

He joined the Social Democratic Party in 1903, and later he became a member of the Central Union of Trade, transport, and traffic workers of Germany and ascended to the chairman of the ‘Department carters’. In late October 1918, while on home leave from the front, Thälmann deserted from the army and joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. Thälmann helped to organize the Hamburg Uprising of October 1923, whose failure forced Thälmann was forced to go into hiding. In February 1925 he became chairman of the KPD’s paramilitary organization, the Roter Frontkämpferbund and later this year Thälmann headed the KPD and thus a candidate for the German Presidency. Thälmann’s candidacy in the second round of the presidential election split the center-left vote, ensuring that the conservative Paul von Hindenburg defeated the Centre Party’s, Wilhelm Marx. In March 1932, Thälmann was once again a candidate for the German Presidency, against the incumbent Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler. The KPD’s slogan was «A vote for Hindenburg is a vote for Hitler; a vote for Hitler is a vote for war». After the National Socialists came to power in January 1933, Thälmann proposed that the SPD and KPD should organize a general strike to topple National Socialist rule together. By that time, however, National Socialists had risen to power and the KPD had been largely destroyed."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_PIECK_DESC: "Willhelm Pieck has been drawn to socialist ideas since he was a teenager — in 1894 Pieck joined the woodworkers’ federation, which steered him towards joining the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) the following year. Pieck became the chairman of the party’s urban district in 1899, and in 1906 became full-time secretary of the SPD. During the Great War, although the majority of the SPD supported the German government, Pieck was a member of the party’s left wing, which opposed the war, what led to his arrest and detention in a military prison. Upon his return to Berlin in 1918, Pieck joined the newly founded Communist Party of Germany (KPD). On 16 January 1919 Pieck, along with Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, was arrested while meeting at Berlin Eden Hotel. While the two were murdered, Pieck managed to escape. In 1922, he became a founding member of the International Red Aid, serving first on the executive committee.

Upon the election of Friedrich Ebert as Reich President on 11 February 1919, he acted as presiding officer of the SPD and was formally elected chairman on 14 June. In 1920, Wels organized the general strike that helped defeat the right-wing Kapp Putsch. After the Preußenschlag of July 1932 against Otto Braun’s government in the Free State of Prussia, he spoke against a general strike, but after the Reichstag election of November 1932, he rejected any negotiations with the new chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher. On 23 March 1933 Wels was the only member of the Reichstag to speak against Adolf Hitler’s Enabling Act. Speaking directly to Hitler, Wels proclaimed, «You can take our lives and our freedom, but you cannot take our honor. We are defenseless but not honourless»."
 POLITICS_WERNER_VON_BLOMBERG_DESC: "Werner von Blomberg has had a promising career. He joined German General Staff in 1908 and proudly served the Empire, earning him a Pour le Mérite for his heroism during the Great War. When the monarchy was abolished and the Empire transformed into a republic, he was appointed chief of staff of the Stuttgart Army Area and later was promoted to chief of the Troop Office, serving as a de-facto Military Minister. However, he has never been a proponent of democracy — in 1928, Blomberg visited the Soviet Union, where he was much impressed by the high status of the Red Army, and left a convinced believer in the value of totalitarian dictatorship as the prerequisite for military power. He welcomed Nazi Party accession, and much to Hitler’s satisfaction, he became a Reichsminister of Defence, and later rose to the ranks of Reichsminister of War & Wehrmacht Commander-in-Chief. His future looks bright, but it’s no doubt that he has also made enemies along the way."
 POLITICS_LUDWIG_BECK_DESC: "In 1933, upon witnessing the Nazi Machtergreifung, Ludwig Beck wrote, «I have wished for years for the political revolution, and now my wishes have come true. It is the first ray of hope since 1918». He took the German defeat in the Great War very personally, he despised the Entente for dismantling his Homeland, and throughout all his command appointments in the Weimar republic, he hoped that revenge will come. Ludwig Beck never aligned himself with Nazi ideology, hell, he even expressed his skepticism over Hitler on several occasions. However, he believed that it was the NSDAP rule only that can restore the German glory. General Beck became a Chief of the General Staff of the German Army High Command, hoping that it will be him who avenge the errors of the past. The only problem is that he is not the only one."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC: "Wilhelm II has already proven that he won’t be an ordinary monarch. After all, how many emperors have been named war criminals and the main instigators of the greatest war in the history of mankind? In a span of 10 years, he lost his country, his people, his family, and even his respect. Thank god for Wilhelmina - who knows where he would have been if not for her firm determination to let the former German emperor and the Royal family stay. He spend his exile time without any hope of ever return to the throne, but perhaps, history is not over yet."
 POLITICS_OTTO_STRASSER_DESC: "If anyone will ever say that Otto Strasser is not a real National Socialist, this person is a fool! The difference is that he’s more occupied with the «Socialist» part. A former activist of the Nazi Party, he resigned in 1930 so that to not be expelled. That same year, he formed a Combat League of Revolutionary National Socialists, a political group that truly embodied his views. Due to his displeasure with the NSDAP, he was exiled to Czechoslovakia. Guess they were just afraid of Strasserism — a more radical, mass-action, and worker-based form of the ideology to achieve a national rebirth. His time will come, and true caring, and strong Germany will rise again to exterminate its enemies."
 POLITICS_ERNST_NIEKISCH_DESC: "Ernst Niekish, the most famous National Bolshevik in Germany, started his career in the ranks of Social Democrats in 1917. Unfortunately, he was so vehemently opposed to the Dawes Plan, the Locarno Treaties, and the general pacifism of the SPD that he was expelled in 1926. In his journal Widerstand (Resistance), he praised the Soviet Union as a continuation of both Russian nationalism and the old state of Prussia. He also believed in the necessity of a German-Soviet alliance against the «decadent West» and the Treaty of Versailles. The attempt to combine ultranationalism and communism, two extreme ends of the political spectrum, caused Niekisch’s National Bolsheviks to be a force with little support. Although anti-Jewish and in favor of a totalitarian state, Niekisch rejects Adolf Hitler, who he feels lacked any real socialism, and Niekisch instead looks up to Soviet Russia and the industrial development of the Soviet Union as his model for the Führerprinzip."
 POLITICS_JULIUS_LEBER_DESC: "Julius Leber has joined the German Social Democratic Party in 1913 and was twice wounded during the Great War. After the war, he enlisted in the Reichswehr. In 1920, during the Kapp Putsch, he took the Weimar Republic’s side. He soon resigned, as most commanders of the Reichswehr participated in the putsch or sympathized with it to some extent. From 1921 to 1933, he was a member of parliament in Lübeck, in 1924-1933, he was a member of the Reichstag, where he was primarily engaged in defense issues. On 31 January 1933, the NSDAP, the SA, the SS, the Steel Helm and the State Military Union held a torchlit procession in Lübeck on the occasion of Hitler’s rise to power. This provoked clashes between the Nazis and the police guarding them on the one hand and the Social Democratic paramilitary organization Reichsbanner (led by Leber in this city) and other anti-Nazi forces on the other. After this Leber was arrested, but was soon released on the demand of the workers of Lübeck. In March 1933, he was arrested again, despite his parliamentary immunity. He was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment on the charge of being the ‘mastermind’ for the murder of a Nazi."
 POLITICS_KURT_SCHUMACHER_DESC: "Karl Schumacher, Kurt Schumacher’s father, was a merchant and liberal politician, a city councilman for the German Freedom Party. Despite his bourgeois family influence, Kurt had been imbued with the ideas of Social Democracy in the revisionist interpretation of Eduard Bernstein since his youth. He was also interested in the legacy of Lassalle and Marx. Schumacher combined internationalism and social democracy with German national patriotism. The day after the outbreak of the First World War, Kurt Schumacher volunteered for the army of the German Empire. He fought on the Eastern front, took part in the battle of Łódź; on December 2, 1914 he was seriously wounded, which led to the amputation of his right arm. He was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and demobilized. While still in training, on January 8, 1918, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He advocated the participation of the working class and Social Democracy in public affairs, the strengthening of national defense (especially in the East), and against the strike movement in wartime. In 1920, Kurt Schumacher arrived in Stuttgart, where he headed the editorial board of the local Social Democratic newspaper Schwäbische Tagwacht. He acted as a convinced and active opponent of the Communist and Nazi parties. He formed and led in Stuttgart the Reichsbanner, a paramilitary militia of Social Democrats against the Communist Roth Front and the Nazi SA. Kurt Schumacher was elected to the Landtag in 1924, and from 1928 was head of the SPD organization in Stuttgart. In the election to the Reichstag on 20 May 1928, Schumacher was a few votes short, but in 1930 he was still elected to the Reichstag. In 1932, 37-year-old Kurt Schumacher became the youngest member of the national SPD leadership. As a socialist, Schumacher was in consistent opposition to the Brüning, Papen and Schleicher cabinets, and as a democrat he stood up to the NSDAP and the SPD. In a parliamentary speech on February 23, 1932, Kurt Schumacher called Hitler’s propaganda «appeal to swine» and «mobilization of stupidity». In August 1932 he became a member of the SPD faction leadership."

 POLITICS_IMAM_YAHYA_DESC: "Imam Yahya has ruled Yemen since 1918, simultaneously holding the title of king and imam. His theocratic rule relies on the support of tribes adhering to the Zeidite version of Shiism, which displeases Sunni Shafia and Shiite Ismailis living in the south and west of the country. The Imam is highly suspicious of foreign influence and has adopted a policy of isolation from the outside world. He once said: «I would rather that my people and I remain poor and eat straw than let foreigners in, or give them concessions, no matter what advantage or wealth might result from their presence». However, Imam Yahya’s motivation is more patriarchal than tyrannical; he believes that as a descendant of Muhammad, he has to protect the Imamate from the corrupting influence of modernity.\n\nImam Yahya, like all members of the Hamidaddin dynasty, one of the branches of the ancient Rashid family, bears the honorific title Sayyid, which denotes that the Imam belongs to the generally recognized descendants of the Prophet. Descent from Muhammad increases Yahya’s authority and the legitimacy of his rule."

After receiving an education in the United States, upon returning home, he immediately plunged into political intrigue, and helped overthrow President Adolfo Lias, thus obtaining the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs and the rank of general. With the help of the U.S. Marine Corps, which was occupying Nicaragua at the time, Somoza became the head of the National Guard. Taking advantage of his post, he ordered the assassination of Sandino, which, with the subsequent confrontation with President Sakosa, raised his popularity to an unprecedented level, which made him able to stand at the head of the country."
 POLITICS_JUAN_BAUTISTA_SACASA_DESC: "A doctor by training, Sakasa taught at the national University and was a supporter of the liberal regime of Zelaya. In 1924, he became actively involved in politics by joining the coalition of conservatives and liberals, but a year later he fled to Mexico, due to the coup of General-President Chamorro, who eventually resigned without gaining recognition from the United States. However, the uprising of liberal soldiers in Puerto Cabezas gave him a unique opportunity, and he created a government there, securing the rights of a constitutional president. Shortly after the small civil war, which was stopped by the United States, an armistice was concluded, the result of which was the subsequent election of Sakasa as president in 1932, marking the end of the presence of the US Armed Forces in the country."

This led to the fact that in 1936 he joined the Dobayma Asayon and even helped to conclude a temporary alliance with the Ba Mo Poor People's Party. He came to the conclusion that the main enemy in the new war was world fascism, and called for the unification of democrats and communists in order to overthrow it.

 POLITICS_FUMIMARO_KONOE_DESC: "Fumimaro Konoe was born in Tokyo on October 12, 1891, into the famous Konoe family, one of the main branches of the ancient Fujiwara clan. This made Konoe the head of the most prestigious and high-ranking noble house in the Empire. While the average height of the Japanese at that time was about 160 cm (5 ft 3 in), Konoe's height was over 180 cm. At Kyoto Imperial University, Fumimaro studied socialism, translating Oscar Wilde's book "The Human Soul under Socialism" into Japanese. There he met genro Saionji Kinmochi and became his protege. After graduation, Fumimaro turned to Saionji for advice on starting a political career and worked for a while at the Ministry of the Interior before accompanying his mentor to Versailles as part of the Japanese peace delegation. During the Paris Peace Conference, Konoe was one of the Japanese diplomats who put forward a proposal for racial equality for the League of Nations Pact. However, US President Woodrow Wilson and representatives of the race canceled the vote, saying that this point needed unanimous support. Konoe took the rejection of the article on racial equality very negatively, considering it a humiliation of Japan. And in December 1918, he also published an essay entitled "Reject Anglo-American-centered Pacifism." In this article, he argued that Western democracies support democracy, peace and self-determination only hypocritically, while in fact undermining these ideals through racially discriminatory imperialism. He attacked the League of Nations as an attempt to institutionalize the status quo: the colonial hegemony of the Western powers. His mentor Saionji considered Konoe's essay reckless, but after it began to be read all over the world, Konoe was invited to dinner by Sun Yat-sen. Sun admired Japan's rapid modernization; they discussed pan-Asian nationalism over dinner. Konoe was distinguished by his tall stature, slender figure, on which both kimono and tailcoat looked equally organically, aristocratic features, fragile health and increased excitability. Born under the sign of Libra, he was prone to frequent mood swings, fell into melancholy and referred to ill health when it was necessary to make decisions, for which he was nicknamed the "melancholic prince", and his "weak will" became a byword among journalists and analysts. Since the early 30s, Konoe came to the forefront of the political life of the country, but did not actively participate in the struggle for power: a direct descendant of Fujiwara, once the all-powerful regents under the emperors, with whom Konoe was related by blood, probably believed that she belonged to him by birthright. The presidency of the House of Peers suited him perfectly."

After the successful completion of the mission, Yenai was promoted to Vice Admiral in December 1930. Yenai supported the conclusion of the London Naval Treaty, which established the ratio of the US Navy, Great Britain and Japan — 5:5:3. Thus, he joined the Treaty Faction and was attacked by the "hawks" in the navy, as was his close friend Isoroku Yamamoto. As the Minister of the Navy, Yenai was known as a man of few words. His speeches were usually short and delivered with an almost indistinct Nambu accent. Written records of his speeches account for only half of the speeches of his contemporaries. On the other hand, he is a lover of alcohol and can drink it in very large quantities while remaining sober. He met the incident on February 26 at his mistress's, two blocks from the scene of the events, but did not suspect what was happening. When he returned to his naval base, he was one of the first to call the rebels "rebel soldiers", mobilized the marines and declared his loyalty to the emperor, for which he earned great trust from him."
